# Tailwind CSS Styling Issues: Unexpected Behavior or Missing Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS projects where styles don't apply as expected. The problem lies in the configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`), where the `content` array might not correctly include all the files that are using Tailwind classes.  This could also be caused by incorrect plugin installation or conflicts with other stylesheets. 

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an example configuration with potential errors in the paths that are included in the `content` array.  This leads to Tailwind not correctly processing classes within the project.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected configuration. Ensuring that the `content` array accurately reflects the file structure and file types in your project is essential.
